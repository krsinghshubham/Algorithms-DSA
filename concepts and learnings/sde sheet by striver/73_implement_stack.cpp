//1. stack.
/*
For implemntation using array.
* Pros: Easy to implement. Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.
* Cons: It is not dynamic. It doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime.
*/
//2. stack using linked list.
/*
For implemetation using stack.
*Pros: The linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.
*Cons: Requires extra memory due to involvement of pointers.
